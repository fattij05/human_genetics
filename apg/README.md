# APG study (manuscript companion)

This module contains analyses for the APG contig study focused on reference representation:

1. Linear alignment behavior on T2T-CHM13 (BWA-MEM vs minimap2) and behavior classes (L1–X)
2. Graph-based rescue and genomic context
3. Population representation across 47 haplotype-resolved assemblies
4. Graph-conditioned assessment of linear representativeness (including surjection comparisons)
5. Functional and transcriptional evidence for reference-unresolved contigs

Notes:
- This repository is a reproducibility platform; large alignment files are not committed.
- Small summary tables and figure outputs are versioned and committed.
